                Who is Basma?
            </h1>
            <p>Basma is a young lady in her twenties who was born in the beautiful country of Morocco in the north of Africa. Basma
            received her education in economy from one of the most known universities in Morocco. Currently, Basma calls Orlando
            home and enjoys everything this city has to offer. Basma’s love for cooking started at an early age. She loved to hang
            out by the kitchen enjoying the smells of the aromas coming from there. Since then, Basma focused on learning how to
            make most of the dishes she liked. She started by helping her mother prepare amazing dishes, learning new tips and
            techniques in the process.
            Step by step, Basma was able to make most of the signature Moroccan dishes and pastries to perfection. Afterwards, Basma
            started exploring international cuisine and began learning some of the cooking methods involved in making dishes that
            were different than the ones she knew. Pizzas, different styles of pasta and lasagna, beef Bourguignon and seafood boils
            were all new inspirations that had Basma experiment with new cuisines.
            Basma also likes baking and making pastries and cakes. Besides a verity of Moroccan pastries, Basma has learned to make
            Napoleon’s French pastries, puff pastries, Eclairs, tarts, cupcakes, and multilayered cakes for birthdays and other
            special occasions.
            Even though Basma has never received a formal culinary education, the dishes she makes are executed to a level of
            perfection similar to that of seasoned culinary chefs. Basma aspires to be a chef at her own restaurant and plans to
            join a culinary program to further expand her culinary knowledge.</p>
